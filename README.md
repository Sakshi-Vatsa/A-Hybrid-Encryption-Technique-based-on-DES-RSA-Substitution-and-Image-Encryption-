This a new model for Encryption - Decryption of textual data. The model is inspired by 2 research papers:

In this model, textual data is first encrypted using 2-DES Encryption. The encrypted results further undergo 2 Step encryption using Substitution Cipher. The results are then hidden in a rose image using Stenography. Meanwhile, the key for DES Encryption is encrypted using RSA Encryption Algorithm.

The resultant text is cipher text.
